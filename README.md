# Character-Sheet-Manager
An easy way to create D&D character sheets!

### What is Character Sheet Manager?
D&D is a fun game. It allows you to create all sorts of characters with no
limits but your imagination. And now, creating a new character is even easier
with Character Sheet Manager.
Although you can create anything in D&D, it can be quite a boring and
mechanical task. The Character Sheet Manager fits in this particular space.
You will no longer need to go page to page in the Player's Handbook, copying
and pasting information about your race, class, background, etc.
Character Sheet Manager allows you to create a new Character by only choosing
the necessary items. Fixed features are automatically assigned to your
character, with absolutely no need for manual labor.

### What it does?
With CSM, you can create, see, and edit your character sheets more easily.

Creating a new character step-by-step with Character Sheet Manager:
1. Choose your race.
2. Choose your class.
3. Choose your background.
4. Choose your level.
5. Select in which way you want to generate your abilities values (Random
values, Default Values, Buying Values) and distribute them between your
abilities.
6. Choose your alignment.
7. Choose between your options of skills.
8. Choose between your options of languages.
9. Select between choosing and buying your equipment.
10. Choose the info associated with the background and your physical
appearance.

You can also see all your character's information with the CSM, the bits you
chose directly, and the ones that came indirectly with your choices.

There are two different ways to edit your sheet. In the 'Edit Sheet' section,
you can redefine some chosen information (some, fundamentally important to
the character, you can not, like race, class, background). In the 'Play'
section, you can edit information related to character development in the
sessions' game.

### How to use it?
This is an extremely initial version of my idea, as I describe all the things
I still want to do in it right below. But, even though it is not at its
maximum yet, the program is usable. For now, the way to execute the program
is by downloading the files from GitHub. In the terminal, setting the working
directory to the folder where the files are and typing "python3 main.py". 

### What it will do in the future?
This is a beginning project. I have plannings to expand it way far from its
current state. Some of the new features that I intend to add in the future
are:
1. An User Graphic Interface.
2. Automatically fill the sheet pdf.
3. Accept multi-class characters.
4. Add feats.
5. Create a configuration section to change the pattern in creating new
characters.
6. A way to add new races, classes, backgrounds, and any other info that
isn't in the Player's Handbook.
7. A glossary with all the info that someone might want to know about D&D.
8. A Dungeon's Master version, to show and manage more than just one sheet.

### Who am I?
Hello. My name is Lucas. I am a Computer Science student in Brazil. This is
my biggest project so far and my first real program in Python. I am starting
in this programming world and just really wanted to try new things and to put
into practice my learnings so far.
I know that this program may have several errors, bugs, and more efficient
ways to do what it does. And if, by any chance, you are reading this code and
want to help, to correct something, or show me a better way to code, feel
completely free and appreciated for it. I just feel the need to start doing
something and building real programs.
